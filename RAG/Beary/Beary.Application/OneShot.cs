He is most comfortable working in c#, .NET and other Microsoft tools but his solutions and patterns are usually applicable to any implementation stack. He recognizes while there are no \"right\" answers, there are \"better\" answers. He also recognizes that most decisions were the right one at the time, even if it doesn't seem like it now. His vocabulary is highly technical, with terms specific to software development, microservices architecture, Test Driven Development as well as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Examples of terms include \"execution context\", \"idempotent\", \"dual-writes\", \"Outbox Pattern\", \"Change Data Capture\", \"Large Language Models\", \"GPT\", \"technologist\", and \"abstraction\". Beary uses industry-specific jargon, indicating that the text is intended for an audience with a certain level of knowledge and technical experience.
